# Introduction

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[new.docusaurus.io](https://new.docusaurus.io)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Something missing?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our Canny board, which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
