[Add Katie to your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=1276290213363.1276667698626&scope=channels:history,chat:write,commands,im:history,incoming-webhook,team:read&user_scope=im:history "Katie for Slack")

## How does Katie work inside a Slack channel?
1. A team member asks a question inside a Slack channel, for example "What is the mobile phone number of Katie?" or "Who can recommend a good neuropsychologist?"
2. Katie will analyze the question, for example check whether it is a duplicated question and might has been answered before
3. If Katie is able to provide a good answer, then this was it already!
4. If Katie does not know the answer or if Katie's answer was not helpful or not correct ... 
   * then with a click of a button Katie can forward the question to an expert affiliated with the Slack workspace
   * and when the expert or a teammate is answering the question or correcting Katie's answer, then Katie will learn from the expert's or the teammate's answer and will be able to answer the same or a similar question next time.
5. Consider Katie as a human being who is eager to learn, but with a much better memory and never being impatient :-)
